first we have to train the model and make it pickel or joblib format
already i have kept those pickel and joblib files here it self first download it 
now we have index.html file this file has to be open in any code editors which supports python and sklearn libraries like pycharm or vscode editor.
open all files in those editors.
In editor first we have to create evirtual environment 
import flask, joblibs and all neccesisary libraries in code editor
now run app.py file in that file we have to change all file paths as per your system file paths
after successfully running app.py file we will get one IP address click on that we will redirect to browser where we will find a form 
give inputs in that form and click on predict button then we will get results.
